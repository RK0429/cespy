## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan for cespy, a unified Python toolkit for automating SPICE circuit simulators. The refactoring aims to improve code quality, maintainability, and extensibility while preserving all existing functionality from the merged kupicelib and kuPyLTSpice projects.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths

- Well-organized module structure with clear separation of concerns
- Good use of abstract base classes for extensibility

### Areas for Improvement

- Code duplication across modules (22 files with TODO comments)
- Tight coupling between SimRunner and simulator implementations
- Inconsistent error handling and exception hierarchy
- Mixed responsibilities in some classes
- Platform-specific path handling scattered throughout codebase
- Magic strings and regex patterns not centralized

## Refactoring Goals

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain old APIs with deprecation warnings
2. **Incremental Changes**: Small, focused PRs for easier review
3. **Feature Flags**: Allow toggling between old and new implementations
4. **Rollback Plan**: Tag stable versions before major changes

### Success Metrics

- Reduce average method complexity by 30%
- Achieve 100% type hint coverage
- Zero regression in functionality
